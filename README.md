## 🗣️ About

> In this project, we'll code a simple 2D game to get familiar with the mlx library and UI in general.

### Maps
The game is able to play any map you want as long as it follow some specific rules:
* The map has to be a ``.ber`` file.
* It can only contain some of the following characters:

| Character | Object |
| - | - |
| 1 | Wall. |
| 0 | Empty space. |
| C | Collectable. |
| E | Exit. |
| P | Player starting position. |

* The map must be a rectangle surrounded by walls ‘1’.
* It must have at least one exit ‘E’ and one collectable ‘C’. And only one player ‘P’.

### Controls

Use `WASD` to move. 

| Character | Move |
| - | - |
| W | UP |
| S | DOWN |
| D | RIGHT |
| A | LEFT |

Enemies move after you and will kill you when you move into their tile or they move into yours. After picking up all collectibles, the exits open and you may leave the map.

You can exit the game with `esc` or by pressing the closing window botton.

### Execute the game
To play you can use some of the makefile rules, or execute the file _so_long_ if it's been generated, passing the map you want to play as parameter (``./so_long map.ber``). The make file has the following rules:

| Rule | Function |
| - | - |
| ``make`` | Generates _so_long_ and an object file for each .c. |
| ``make clean`` | Deletes all object files. |
| ``make fclean`` | Deletes the object files and the _so_long_. |
| ``make re`` | makes ``fclean`` and ``make`` again. |
| `` make play`` | Allows you to play all maps one at a time. To play the next map just press ``esc``. |

### Installing the MLX library

* ``Linux``

If you're not using a MacOS device from 42, you'll need to install the libraries manually. Please refer to the [official github](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) for more details. To install it, do the following (requires root access):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git
cd minilibx-linux/
make
sudo cp mlx.h /usr/include
sudo cp libmlx.a /usr/lib
```

* ``MacOS``

To install the library, you will need to first install a package manager like homebrew (check [here](https://brew.sh/)) to then install the X11 package with ``brew install Xquartz``. After that you must extract the minilibx file called ``minilibx_opengl.tgz``. then install it to your system with the following commands (requires sudo as well):

```shell
cd minilibx_opengl
make
sudo cp mlx.h /usr/local/include
sudo cp libmlx.a /usr/local/lib
sudo reboot
```
Note: A reboot is necessary to ensure that the ``Xquartz`` is working properly. You can test if it is by running a test example with the command ``xeyes``.

### Installing the manuals

If you want quick access to the mlx manuals, it is recommended that you copy the files from the ``man`` folder in [minilibx-linux](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) to your system manuals:

* ``Linux``
```shell
sudo cp man/man3/* /usr/share/man/man3/
```
Note: Depending on your Linux configuration, to get the manuals working (e.g. ``man mlx``) you will need to individually gzip all the manual files you just copied, e.g. ``sudo gzip /usr/share/man/man3/mlx.3``.

* ``MacOS``
```shell
sudo cp man/man3/* /usr/X11/share/man/man3
```
